# Ensemble_Model_
This repository contains code for building an ensemble model in machine learning. Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve performance over any single model. This README provides an overview of the ensemble model, its components, and instructions for usage.

## Components
The ensemble model consists of the following components:
1. Base Models: Individual machine learning models used as building blocks for the ensemble. These could be classifiers (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs) or regressors (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines).
2. Ensemble Technique: A method for combining predictions from the base models to make final predictions. Common techniques include:
    - *Voting*: Each model gets a vote, and the majority prediction is chosen.
    - *Averaging*: The predictions of all models are averaged to produce the final prediction.
    - *Stacking*: Predictions of base models are used as features for a meta-learner, which makes the final prediction.
3. Performance Metrics: Metrics used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.

## Usage
To use the ensemble model, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
2. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
3. Choose base models: Select suitable base models based on the nature of your data and the problem at hand.
4. Train base models: Train each base model on the training data.
5. Combine predictions: Use the chosen ensemble technique to combine predictions from the base models.
6. Evaluate performance: Assess the performance of the ensemble model using appropriate metrics on the test set.
7. Fine-tuning: Optionally, fine-tune hyperparameters of the base models or ensemble technique to optimize performance.
8. Deployment: Once satisfied with the performance, deploy the ensemble model for inference on new data.

## Examples
